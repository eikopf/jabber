# New Import Rules

The major rule here comes from gleam: you cannot import a module directly and
then use it as part of a separate import statement. Everything else follows
from that:
1. The non-keyword prefix of an import path can only consist modules or types;
2. Only the last non-item component of an import path can be a type;
3. etc.
