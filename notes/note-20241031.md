# Type Constructor Visibility
Because Rust distinguishes between general coproduct (`enum`) and singular
product (`struct`) types, it can define different rules for the visibility of
their constructors. For pragmatic reasons, `struct` constructors are private by
default, while `enum` constructors are always public.

When a language unifies these type declarations, as Gleam does, those rules for
visibility then need to be redesigned. In Gleam, all type constructors are
public by default, except in the case of the `opaque` keyword, which restricts
the visibility of all type constructors to the local module. Since this keyword
is a modifier for the `type` declaration as a whole, it is not possible to
publicize only a subset of the constructors of a type; in practice this is fine
because mixed public-private type constructors could complicate the picture for
pattern matching.

Implementing an `opaque` keyword for Jabber would be fairly simple: it would
simply be a minor change to the parsing grammar, and result in a small set of
changes to the frontend of the compiler. This would also remove the `pub`
modifier for record fields â€” we will accept the consequence that a record's
fields cannot be partially publicized as a reasonable compromise.
