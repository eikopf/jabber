# Current Status
The majority of the name resolution phase is complete, with the only exception
being the attribute system (whose semantics are still ambiguous anyway). Once
the attribute system is in place, I can move on to implementing the typechecker
and probably a small optimizer stage.

# Typechecking Plans
I intend to use _bidirectional typechecking_ for Jabber, both because it feels
more natural than HM, and because it gives me the headroom to add more complex
type system features in the future; HM is known to struggle with anything that
can be classified as subtyping (including higher-ranked polymorphism).

This might be naive, but I anticipate this stage being easier than the name
resolution stage: there is an order-of-magnitude more writing available on type
checking and inference, and so I just have more to go on.

# Other Tweaks
I think the `int` type should/could be changed to a `BigInt` style type—that
would be `number` in the R6RS numeric hierarchy—since it avoids having to deal
with oddities around integer literal overflow, and I can also leave integer
overflow & underflow undefined for practical purposes.

In a real language, this would be bad: unbounded integers have an intrinsic
performance penalty when compared to the plain machine integer types. But in
this context they neatly answer a number of questions, while also avoiding
questions about differences between platforms and architectures.
